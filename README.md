# Tampermonkey Trello Background#
Pulls a random image from the top of [/r/EarthPorn](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn) as a background on trello boards

## Purpose ##
This gets around some of the benefit of Trello Gold, however, I think this functionality is a lot better.
Rather than having a static image as the bacground for a board it actually pulls an image every 10 minutes and allows you to change it at will.

## Installation ##
**It is recommended to use either [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).** This allows the script to auto-update to the most recent version. The rate of this update can be changed in each extension's preferences.
